<p>El Taco Rey is an authentic Mexican street food restaurant. It was started and continues to be a family owned and family run restaurant. In fact, on a daily basis at any point in the
day you can come in and see the owner and his family here, working hard to provide every customer a unique and great experience. The owners of the restaurant are Mexican born who migrated to
the United States in search of a better future for their family. Since coming here, they have worked hard to achieve the American Dream while also brining and sharing their culture with the city.
</p>
<p> The restaurant started 20 years ago. It was open and successful for 5 years, but the tragedy struck. The family faced some difficult times and so the resraurant had to close for approximately 5 months.
The restaurant has been running continously for almost 15 years since then, winning many prices for the quality of the food and the experience that it offers to everyone whoe steps through the door.
Most recently it won the "Best family owned Indy restaurant 2019" award which is a covited price amongst restaurants in the Indianapolis scene.

One of the secrets to the success of the restaurant, apart from the dedication from the owners, are the quality of ingredients used in the preparation of the food. Every day the family ownersgo out 
to buy fresh ingredients from the local farmer markets. Always making sure that the ingredients are fresh and responsibly sourced. These fresh ingredients give the food an amazing taste
that only the best restaurants can match. On top of that, the food is always prepared at the time of order, so no customer will ever get food that has been pre-made hours ago. This
further ensures that the food always tastes fresh and amazing!</p>
